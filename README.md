# Home-Credit-Default-Risk-Applied-Stat-project
Home Credit Risk Default Competition (https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk)

(Project done for the course Applied Statistics)

This project, based on the Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk, use the previously loan dataset
from Home Credit, a financial institute, to predict the capability of a subject to repay a loan.

This problem is a binary classification problem, where the outcome Y is equal to 1 if a subject has not repaid the debt, 0 otherwise.
The problem is very unbalanced, with the proportion of 1 is more or less 8%, and for this reason detecting the "defaulters" 
is a very challenging task.
